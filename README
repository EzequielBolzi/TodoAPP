I build a REST API in JAVA with SpringBoot, JPA & MySQL. This controller allows performing basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete) on tasks using the defined REST endpoints. It is designed to interact with a task repository (TodoRepository) that provides methods to access and manipulate task data.
